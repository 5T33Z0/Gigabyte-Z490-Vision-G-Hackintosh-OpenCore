## Slimmed Apple ALC Kext

### About
AppleALC kext for the Z490 Vision G Board using Realtek ALC 1220. It only includes Layout-ID 17, which was routed for the Z490 Vision G specifically. It's only 86 KB in size. So a massive reduction in file size compared to the official build (3.7 mb)!

**Version**: 1.7.4

### How to

- Download and extract the .zip
- Replace existing AppleALC kext in EFI folder
- Change Layout-ID in boot-args or Device Properties to `17`   

### Notes

- If you update AppleALC with OCAT or similar, this kext will be overwritten and you're back to stock.
- Don't use this kext with any other Layout-Id than 17 â€“ it's won't work!
