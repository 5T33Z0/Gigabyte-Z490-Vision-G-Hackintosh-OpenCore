## Slimmed AppleALC Kext
>**Current Version**: 1.8.2

### About

- Only contains settings for Realtek ALC 1220
- Only contains Layout-ID `17`, which was routed for the Z490 Vision G specifically. 
- **Only 86 KB in size**! Compared to the size of the official release (3.9 mb) which contains all layouts for all CODECs, this is a size reduction of over 99%.

### Notes

- If you update AppleALC with OCAT or similar, this kext will be overwritten and you're back to stock.
- Don't use this kext with any other Layout-Id than 17 â€“ it won't work!
