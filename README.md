## Overview

This repository provides an OpenCore EFI folder for the Gigabyte Z490 Vision G mainboard, meticulously crafted and maintained since September 2020. The configuration is based on Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide and analysis of an `.ioreg` file from a real `iMac20,1`. USB ports are mapped via ACPI, eliminating the need for a USB kext.

Tested successfully with macOS 10.14 to 15 beta. For best results, read and follow the install instruction carefully and thoroughly.

|⚠️ Important Updates |
|:--------------------|
| Don't report any issues unless you are using the latest BIOS version (F23)!
| macOS Tahoe beta 2 Notes: <ul><li> Disable WhateverGreen during install. Once installation is completed you can re-enable it again and the RX580 will work <li> `AppleHDA` has been removed from beta 2 so no on-board Audio since AppleALC requires AppleHDA <li>Intel I225-V does not work in Tahoe beta 2. Use a PCIe NIC
| Intel I225-V NIC now has a dedicated kext ([**AppleIGC**](https://github.com/SongXiaoXi/AppleIGC)), rendering [**previous fixes**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/main/I225-V_FIX.md) obsolete.
| Upgrading from macOS 14.3.1 to 14.4+ via System Update causes a Kernel Panic. **Fix**: disable `SecureBootModel` ([**Details**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/W_Workarounds/macOS14.4.md)).
| 600/700-series Nvidia Cards require root patching with [**OpenCore Legacy Patcher**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) in Post-Install in order to work.

## Hardware Specifications

Component     | Details                                                       
-------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------- 
**Mainboard** | Gigabyte Z490 Vision G. **BIOS**: F21. F5 or newer is required to disable `CFG Lock`. Otherwise enable Kernel Quirk `AppleXcpmCfgLock`
**CPU**       | Intel Core i9 10850K (Comet Lake)      
**RAM**       | 32 GB DDR4 2400 Crucial Ballistix Sport LT
**iGPU**      | Intel UHD 630 (Headless). Use this [**Framebuffer Patch**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/main/Additional_Files/Graphics/Intel_UHD_630_HDMI_DP_Framebuffer-Patch.plist) if you want to use it for driving a display.
**dGPU**       | Saphire RX580 Nitro+ (4 GB)
**Audio**     | Realtek® ALC1220-VB (Layout-id: `17`)
**Ethernet** <br>(on-board) | Intel I225-V 2.5GbE. Compatible with macOS 10.15.7 and newer. For unknown reasons it only works at 100 mbps for me although it's connected via a CAT 7 cable to a Gigabit switch. This happens in macOS as well as Windows. I have seen other people reporting the same issue with this NIC, so you might consider buying a PCIe LAN Card instead.
**Ethernet** (PCIe)| Intel PRO/1000 PT Dual Port Server Adapter (any macOS version).

## OpenCore Details

### General Information

Parameter | Details                                                       
---------:|----------------------------- 
**SMBIOS** | `iMac20,2`. For i5/i7 CPUs, use `iMac20,1`. SMBIOS data needs to be generated. I use [**OCAT**](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools#readme) for this
**Supported macOS** | macOS 10.14 up to 15.x (10.14 requires `iMac19,1` config)
**OpenCanopy** | Enabled
**Boot Chime** | No
**FileVault** | `Optional`
**SIP** | Current value: `03080000`. Adjust `csr-active-config` based on the used OS and your specific needs.
**SecureBootModel**| `Disabled`. Change to `j185f` for `iMac20,2` SMBIOS. For `iMac20,1`, use `j185`. :warning: Needs to be set to `Disabled` when using an NVIDIA Kepler GPU in macOS 12 or newer (requires root-patching with OCLP)
**USB Port Mapping**| Yes, via ACPI. Details [**here**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/main/Additional_Files/USB/USB_Ports_List.pdf).

## Installing/Upgrading macOS
**Coming from Windows/Linux**: If you are on Windows or Linux, follow the guide provided by [**Dortania**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/#making-the-installer). I provide no support for issues with UBS Installers created in Windows or Linux or when installing macOS into a VM!

**Coming from macOS**: If you already have access to macOS, you can either download macOS from the App Store, via the [**OpenCore Legacy Patcher**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher) App or use [**ANYmacOS**](https://www.sl-soft.de/en/anymacos/). Botch can download macOS High Sierra to Ventura and create a USB Installer as well.

## Deployment
Please read the following explanations carefully and thoroughly and follow the given instructions. In order to boot your PC with this EFI successfully, adjustments to the `config.plist` and used kexts may be necessary to adapt the config to your system configuration and the macOS version you want to install/run.

In general: if your system has the same hardware specs as mine, you can use the EFI folder as us. You only need to enter the required data in the `PlatformInfo/Generic` section (Model, Serial Number, MLB, ROM, etc.).

### Preparing the `config.plist`
Download my latest EFI Folder from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/releases) section and unpack it. Make sure to check the included `Changelog.md` as well, since it contains important information about config changes and useful explanations. 

Select the config of your choice and rename it to `config.plist`. Open it with [**OCAT**](https://github.com/ic005k/QtOpenCoreConfig/releases) or a ProperTree and check the following sections/settings and adjust them to your needs:

1. **ACPI/Add** Section. Add/Enable/Disable SSDTs as needed:
	- [**`DMAR`**] (optional): [DMAR replacement table](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/main/Additional_Files/ACPI/DMAR.dsl) with specific Reserved Memory Regions removed. For 3rd party LAN/Wifi/BT cards that won't work if `VT-D` and the Intel I225-V controller are enabled (macOS Big Sur and newer). 
	- **`SSDT-AWAC-ARTC`**: Custom variant of `SSDT-AWAC.` Disables AWAC Clock and enables `RTC` as `ARTC` instead. Also disables legacy `HPET` device.
	- **`SSDT-PORTS`**: OS-agnostic USB Port Mapping Table for the Z490 Vision G. No additional USB Port kext or quirks are required. Since the USB ports are mapped via ACPI, they will work in *any* version of macOS. Check [**this pdf**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/main/Additional_Files/USB/USB_Ports_List.pdf) for a detailed list of mapped ports.	
	- **`SSDT-PLUG.aml`**: Not required for macOS 12 and newer or when using `CPUFriend.kext` and `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`.

	**NOTES**:
	
 	- **USB**: macOS does not support USB 3.2 via the USB protocol. It requires Thunderbold 3 or newer instead to support speeds greater than 5 Gbit. So there's no speed benefit when using the red USB ports over the blue ones when running macOS!
  	- Additional info about these ACPI Tables can be found [**here**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features#readme)

2. **ACPI/Delete** Section
	- **Drop OEM DMAR Table** &rarr; Only enable if you need to use the DMAR replacement table. OpenCore 0.9.2 introduced a new Quirk called `DisableIoMapperMapping`. It works independently of `DisableIoMapper` and addresses reoccurring connectivity issues in macOS 13.3+ which weren't there before. If your configuration required to drop/replace the DMAR table before it still does now!
	- **Drop OEM USB Port Map (xh_cmsd4)** &rarr; Drops the original USB Port mapping so `SSDT-PORTS.aml` can replace it.
	- **Drop HPET Table** &rarr; Drops the table for the High Precision Event Timer which is now a legacy device.

3. **Booter** Section
	- **Booter/MMIOWhitelist**
		- I added these memory regions after analyzing the bootlog. Since I don't know if these are used by all systems, I disabled them.
		- To figure out which ones can be whitelisted, [**follow this guide**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/12_MMIO_Whitelist)
		- This is not a necessity, just some fine-tuning.
	- **Booter/Patch**: OpenCore patches used to skip the board-id check as part of a [**workaround**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/S_System_Updates) to fix System Update Notifications. Only needed when using an NVIDIA Kepler Card which requires disabling `SecureBootModel` and `SIP` in oder to install and load the GPU drivers.
	- **Booter/Quirks**: If your GPU supports resizable BAR (enable Above 4G Decoding and Resizable BAR in BIOS), you can set `ResizeAppleGpuBars` to `0`. But leave `UEFI/Quirks` at `-1` to not affect the BAR size in other OSes.

4. **DeviceProperties**
	- ~~`#PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x1)/Pci(0x0,0x0)` &rarr; Disabled device-id spoof for the Intel I-225V. &rarr; Only required when running macOS Catalina! Delete the `#` to enable it. Requires `Kernel/Patch` as well. [**Read this**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/main/I225_stock_vs_cstmfw.md#readme) for getting the Intel(R) I225-V Ethernet Controller to work on different versions of macOS.~~ No longer required.
	- `#PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)` &rarr; Disabled Framebuffer for using the iGPU for driving a display. Delete the leading `#` to enable it.
	- `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3)` &rarr; Settings for on-board audio. Also contains the Layout-id
	- `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)` &rarr; Headless Framebuffer for using the iGPU for computational tasks only. 
		- Disable this entry when using the `iMacPro1,1` or `MacPro7,1` SMBIOS.
		- Delete/Disable the `enable-metal` property when using a AMD (Big) Navi Card, since these cards support Metal 3.

5. **Kernel/Add** Section. The following Kexts are disabled by default since I don't know which CPU, GPU, Hard Disk and SMBIOS you will be using:

	- `CPUFriend.kext` and `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`. Create your own CPUFriendDataProvider in Post-Install with [**CPUFriendFriend**](https://github.com/corpnewt/CPUFriendFriend) to optimize CPU Power Management [**as explained here**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/main/Additional_Files/CPU_Pwr/README.md). It is recommended to create a new Data Provider kext after switching the SMBIOS and/or updating/upgrading macOS.
	- `RestrictEvents`: 
		- Required when using `MacPro7,1` SMBIOS &rarr; Disables warnings about unpopulated RAM slots.
		- Also required for enabling the `VMM-x86_64` Board-id so OTA updates work when `SIP` is not fully enabled and `SecureBootModel` is set to `Disabled` (necessary when using NVIDIA Kepler Cards in macOS 12+).
	- `AppleALC.kext`: Slimmed version of AppleALC I compiled myself. It only contains Layout `17` and is only 86 kB in size. If you want to use a different Layout, you need to use the regular version of AppleALC or [compile your own](https://github.com/5T33Z0/AppleALC-Guides/tree/main/Slimming_AppleALC).

6. **Kernel/Quirks**: 
	- **`AppleXcpmCfgLock`**: If your BIOS does not provide the option to disable CFG Lock (requires BIOS Update), enable this Quirk.
	- **`CustomSMBIOSGuid`**: If you don't have Microsoft Windows installed, you can unselect it.
	- **`DisableIoMapperMapping`**: Introduced in OpenCore 0.9.2, it is used to "resolve compatibility issues with Wi-Fi, Ethernet and Thunderbolt devices when `AppleVTD` is enabled". Needs to be enabled when using `AppleIGC.kext` for driving the Intel I225-V NIC and 3rd party WiFi/BT cards.

7. **Misc/Security**: 
	- `SecureBootModel`: 
		- Set to to `j185` (for iMac20,1) or `j185f` (for iMac20,2).
		- Set to `Disabled` if you are using an NVIDIA Kepler Card and for installing macOS Sonoma and newer. Otherwise the system will crash on boot. In this case you also need to enable `RestrictEvents.kext` to enable the `VMM-x86_64` board-id so OTA updates will work. More details [**here**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/S_System_Updates). 

8. **NVRAM/Add**
	- `4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102`: 
		- `revpatch:sbvmm` &rarr; Setting for RestrictEvents.kext to enable the board-id VMM spoof. Only required if you have to disable `SIP` and `SecureBootModel` in order to boot with patched in NVIDIA Drivers for Kepler GPUs.
		- Boot-args: based on the [fix](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/main/I225-V_FIX.md#option-1-using-a-ssdt-with-corrected-header-description) you are using to get the Intel I225-V working in macOS 12 and newer, you might need `dk.e1000=0` (macOS Big Sur) and/or `e1000=0` (macOS Monterey+). 
		- OCLP-Settings: `-allow_amfi` &rarr; Required for OpenCore Legacy Patcher so Kepler Drivers can be installed
	- `7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82`: 
		- Change `csr-active-config` to disable SIP:
			- SIP fully enabled: `00000000`
			- **Big Sur** and newer:
				-  `03080000` (0x803) &rarr; Default Require if you need to apply root patches with OCLP.
				-  `030A0000` (0xA03) &rarr; Required for systems with legacy NVIDIA GPUs that require root patchin with OCLP and loading 3rd party kexts (Nvidia WebDrivers)
			- **Mojave/Catalina**: `EF070000` (0x7EF)
			- **High Sierra**: `FF030000` (0x3FF)
	
9. **PlatfotmInfo/Generic** Section: 
	- Generate SMBIOS data for `iMac20,1` (for Core i9) or `iMac20,2` (for Core i5/i7)
	- If you're not using Windows on your system, change `UpdateSMBIOSMode` from `Custom` to `Create`

10. Save the `config.plist`

> [!IMPORTANT] 
>
> <ul><li> AMD GPUs may require additional `boot-args`. Check WhateverGreen's documentation for details. <li> Applying root patches with OCLP results in a broken security seal which affects System Updates: incremental (or delta) system updates won't work after that. Instead, the full macOS installer (about 12 GB) will be downloaded every time a system update is available. See https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/S_System_Updates/OTA_Updates.md for a workaround to apply incremental updates so you don't have to download the full installer every time.

### Testing the EFI

1. Copy the EFI Folder to a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive for testing
2. Reboot
3. Perform an NVRAM Reset (hit Space Bar to reveal the option)
4. Boot macOS from the USB flash drive
5. If your system boots successfully, mount your ESP and copy over the EFI Folder to you HDD/SSD and reboot.
6. Continue with Post-Install!

## Post-Install

### Strengthen Security (recommended)
Once you got macOS running, you should change the following settings to make your system more secure:

1. Change `SecureBootModel` from `Disabled` to `j185` (for iMac20,1) or `j185f` (for iMac20,2). `SecureBootModel` is only applicable to macOS Catalina and newer.
2. Change `csr-active-config` to `00000000` to enable System Integrity Protection (SIP). Lower/Disables SIP when using a legacy NVIDIA GPU!
3. Under `UEFI/APFS`, change `MinDate` and `MinVersion` from `-1` (disabled) to the correct values for the macOS version you are using. A list with correct values can be found [**here**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/A_Config_Tips_and_Tricks#mindateminversion-settings-for-the-apfs-driver).</br>

> [!WARNING]
> 
> You should have a working backup of your EFI folder on a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive since changing these settings can prevent the system from booting. You may have to disable them for installing macOS Monterey if you have issues.

### Optimizing CPU Power Management (recommended)

You can follow my [**guide**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/main/Additional_Files/CPU_Pwr/README.md) to generate a `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` which works alongside `CPUFriend.kext` to optimize CPU Power Management for a more efficient performance. Have a look at the CPU behavior using Intel Power Gadget. The CPU idle frequency should be lower after adding the kexts.

</details>

### Calculate a Scan Policy (optional)
The items displayed in OpenCore's Boot Picker menu are based on a combination of bits representing supported devices (SATA, NVME, USB, etc.) and file systems (APFS, HFS, NTFS, etc.). There are 24 bits which can be turned on and off to modify what's displayed in the Boot Picker. The combination of selected bits create what's called the `ScanPolicy`. It's located under in the `config.plist` under `Misc/Security`. The default value of my EFI is `0` (everything). Although this is great for compatibility, it will also display EFI Folders on drives which are not the boot drive as well.

To change the `ScanPolicy` to your liking, you can use the [**OpenCore ScanPolicy Generator**](https://oc-scanpolicy.vercel.app/). I am using `2687747` for example which hides EFI Folders and NTFS Drives. To add a custom entry for a Windows Disk to OpenCore's Boot Picker [**follow my guide**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/I_Windows/Custom_Entries.md). Otherwise you can just boot Windows from the BIOS Boot Menu (F12) which also bypasses all the OpenCore injections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Using an incorrect `ScanPolicy` can lead to an empty Boot Menu without any entries. So make sure you have a working Backup of your EFI folder!

### Changing Themes
Besides the included themes from Acidanthera which provide the standard macOS look and feel, I've added 2 additional themes: `BsxM1` (default) and `EnterTwilight`. To change them, do the following:

- Open `config.plist`
- Go to Misc/Boot and change `PickerVariant` to: `Blackosx\BsxM1` or `velickovicdj\EnterTwilight`
- Save and reboot

To revert the changes, enter `Acidanthera\GoldenGate` as `PickerVariant` and change the Flavour of the NVRAM Reset Tool back to `Auto`.

## macOS Tahoe RX580 test scenarios

On my system, macOS Tahoe only runs, if the RX580 GPU is deisabled and the iGPU is used for graphics. The table below lists the tested config scenarios.

| Test | SMBIOS Model | GPU | iGPU (Mode) | Boot Arguments | Result |
|:---:|--------------|-----|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | iMac20,2     | On  | Enabled (Headless) | None           | Fails to boot macOS Tahoe |
| 2 | MacPro7,1    | On  | Disabled           | `-wegnoigpu`   | Fails to boot macOS Tahoe |
| 3 | iMac20,2     | On  | Enabled (Display)  | None           | Fails to boot macOS Tahoe |
| 4 | iMac20,2     | Off | Enabled (Display)  | `-wegnoegpu`   | Boots macOS Tahoe via iGPU (Display on onboard HDMI) |

### A note about the effect of the `Advise Features` setting on GPU/iGPU

- If the GPU is enabled and the iGPU is configured for display output (ie if a Framebuffer Patch is present), the System won't boot any macOS if `Advise Features` is disabled
- However, if 'Advise Features` is enabled, you can boot macOS Sequoia and older with displays connected to the GPU and the iGPU. Firefox glitches in this case, but it works
- Hower, when attempting to boot macOS Tahoe with this configuration, the WindowServer crashes. You have to use `-wegnoegpu` to disable the RX580 

Here's a table summarizing the boot behavior and issues with different macOS versions based on the GPU, iGPU configuration, and `Advise Features` setting:

| macOS Version | GPU Enabled | iGPU Configured for Display (Framebuffer Patch) | Advise Features | Boot Outcome | Notes |
|----------|:--------:|:-------------:|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Sequoia and older | Yes | Yes | Disabled | Fails to boot | System won't boot any macOS. |
| Sequoia and older | Yes | Yes | Enabled | Boots successfully | Firefox glitches, but display works with GPU and iGPU. |
| Tahoe | Yes | Yes | Enabled | WindowServer crashes | Requires `-wegnoegpu` to disable RX580 for successful boot. |

This table assumes the use of an RX580 GPU and the iGPU configured for display output with a Framebuffer Patch. 

## Alternate GPU Configurations

### iGPU Optimizations

Listed below, you find results of benchmark tests conducted with Geekbench 5. I was testing Metal 3 performance of the iGPU for 3 different cases: default configuration vs. using Apples GUC Firmware vs. using RPS Control.

**iGPU**: UHD 630 in "offline/headless" configuration</br>
**AAPL,ig-platform-id:** 0300C89B</br>
**SMBIOS**: iMac20,2 </br>
**macOS**: 13.2</br>
**Geekbench**: 5.5.0

Test #| Added Properties | Compute Score | Notes
:----:|------------------|:-------------:|-------
1| `enable-metal`|[4671](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/6259341)| <ul><li> Default <li> Mandatory to enable Metal 3 support in macOS 13 if your dGPU doesn't support it <li> iGPU Freq.: 0,33 GHz </li> 
2| `enable-metal` </br> `igfxfw=2` |[**4808**](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/6259442)| <ul><li> `igfxfw=2` forces loading of Apple Graphics Unit Control (GUC) firmware <li> Slightly higher score <li> GUI feels snappier <li>Slightly faster boot <li> iGPU Freq.: 1,2 GHz <li> Can cause system crashes </li>
3| `enable-metal` </br> `igfxfw=2` </br> `rebuild-device-tree` | [4796](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/6259548) |<ul><li>Rebuilding Device Tree doesn't make a difference <li>iGPU Freq.: 1,2 GHz
4| `enable-metal` </br> `rps-control`| [4754](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/6259487) | <ul><li> Uses RPS control patch (whatever that is) <li> Slightly lower score compared to using `igfxfw=2` <li> iGPU Freq: 1,2 GHz
5| `enable-metal`</br>`igfxfw=2`</br> `rebuild-device-tree` </br>`rps-control`| [4798](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/6259133) | <ul> <li> Same result as Test #3 <li> iGPU Freq.: 1,2 GHz

**Conclusions**: 

- Test #2 produced the best result. But it's not really a significant increase in performance compared to the default configuration used in test #1. It basically runs the iGPU at a higher base frequency so the energy consumption is higher as well. It also seems that this setting is uncapped in terms of max frequency. This resulted in my system crashing sometimes when watching YouTube because the iGPU frequency went through the roof. So you might consider not using `igfxfw=2`.
- Results of Tests #3 and #5 are virtually identical. That's because `igfxfw=2` takes precedence over `rps-control`, so you shouldn't combine these two properties!

### Enabling Resizable BAR (optional)

- Check if your GPU supports resizable BAR – you can use GPU-Z in Windows for that. The RX 580 I am using does support it
- In your config, change the following settings:
	- `Booter/Quirks`: change `ResizeAppleGpuBars` from `-1` to `0` which will update GPU registers to their defaults when booting macOS
	- `UEFI/Quirks`: Leave `ResizeGpuBars` at `-1` so other OSes are not affected by this change
- Save your config and reboot
- Enter the BIOS 
- Change the following Options:
	- Enable `Above 4G Decoding` (otherwise the Resizable BAR option is not available)
	- Change Resizable BAR mode to: `Auto`

**NOTES**: 

- Enabling resizable BAR slightly increases performance (approx. 10 %).

### AMD GPUs and different SMBIOSes
If you have an AMD GPU and want to benefit from improved performance of Polaris, Vega and (Big) Navi and cards, you can switch to SMBIOS `iMacPro1,1` or `MacPro7,1` instead. Since these Macs don't have an iGPU, tasks like  Quick Sync Video and HEVC encoding are then handled by the GPU instead. More details about choosing the right SMBIOS can be found [**here**](https://caizhiyuan.gitee.io/opencore-install-guide/extras/smbios-support.html#how-to-decide)

**Mind the following**:

- Additional [config edits](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/11_Graphics/GPU/AMD_Radeon_Tweaks#config-edits) are required when switching the SMBIOS, so that the card works as intended.
- If you are using CPUFriend, you have to generate a new `CpuFriendDataprovider.kext` with CPUFriendFriend and replace the previously used on tp adapt CPU Power Management to the new SMBIOS.

#### Addressing DRM issues with AMD GPUs in macOS 11 and newer
The `shikigva` boot-arg previously used to [**address DRM issues**](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/blob/master/Manual/FAQ.Chart.md) is no longer supported in macOS Monterey and newer. 

Instead, **'unfairgva=x'** (x = number from 1 to 7) must be used now. It's a bitmask containing 3 bits (1, 2 and 4) which can be combined to enable different features (and combinations thereof) as [**explained here**](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/351752-amd-gpu-unfairgva-drm-sidecar-featureunlock-and-gb5-compute-help/)

### Using NVIDIA Kepler Cards in macOS 12 and newer
Apple removed support for NVIDIA GeForce Cards from macOS Monterey beta 7 onward. So users with NVIDIA  Kepler GPUs (GTX 700, etc.) need to reinstall them in post-install using [**OpenCore Legacy Patcher**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher).

#### Config Preparation
Change the following settings in `config.plist`:

- `Misc/Security/SecureBootModel`: Change it to `Disabled` &rarr; Required to load NVIDIA drivers – otherwise the system would crash during boot
- `Kernel/Add`: Enable `RestrictEvents.kext` &rarr; This enables the VMM board-id spoof. Required for [**OTA System Updates**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/S_System_Updates) to work with SIP disabled
- `csr-active-config`: Change to `03080000` before applying root patches with OCLP

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Applying root patches breaks the seal of the snapshot volume. Once the seal is broken, incremental OTA updates are no longer available in System Updates. Therefore, each time a System Update is available, the full macOS Installer (approx 15 GB) will be downloaded – and after the update is installed, OCLP has to re-apply the root patches again.
